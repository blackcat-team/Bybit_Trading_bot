# Roadmap context

This roadmap prioritizes future work; it is not authorization to combine items in one task. Each stage is its own [unit of work](../../AGENTS.md#unit-of-work).

## HIGH

1. Telegram update without an effective message — done.
2. Truthful SL/TP display in `/orders` — done.
3. Reconciliation of manual/external position closure — done.
4. SL/TP changes from `/pos` — done at commit `cb179a4`.
5. Percentage-based SL in a signal — next, not started.
6. Verification of actual state after Bybit writes — after HIGH-5.

## Release policy

- The production server is not updated after every HIGH commit. Merging is not deploying.
- HIGH-4, HIGH-5, and HIGH-6 are batched into one release and reviewed together in a release QA pass.
- After release QA passes, the Human Operator performs one deployment, then a runtime smoke check, then a period of observation.
- The Architect sets the order of commit, merge, release QA, deploy, and runtime verification; no agent verdict authorises any of them.

## MID

- Planned and actual risk.
- Protection against duplicate callbacks.
- Health in `/status`.
- Polling-log normalization.
- Position lifecycle logging.
- Ownership of manual positions.

## LOW

- Source analytics.
- Position history.
- Presets.
- Partial-TP UX.
- Structural refactoring after stabilization.
